Core Concepts You’d Need:

    Kinematics: Use Newtonian equations of motion.

    Collision detection: To know when the ball hits a surface.

    Collision response: To handle bouncing, including velocity reversal and energy loss.

    Time stepping: Update the simulation over small intervals.



What You’d Simulate:

    Ball bouncing on the ground:
        
        Apply gravity (g = 9.8 m/s²) each frame.

        Check if the ball’s y-position is at or below the ground.

        Reverse y-velocity when it hits (and maybe multiply by a coefficient like 0.8 for energy loss).

    Ball inside a sphere:
    
        Use 3D coordinates (x, y, z).

        Check if the distance from the ball's center to the origin exceeds the radius.

        Reflect velocity vector based on the collision normal.
